========
BRANDING

It’s more than just a logo, it’s the visual identity for your brand that people first interact with before they decide if they want to learn more or not. My focus is always on telling your story through the logo, typography, colors, and other supporting elements so that you stand out amongst your competitors. 

service 2
========
WEB DESIGN

In an ever-changing digital landscape where online shopping has eclipsed brick & mortar, your web presence means everything. It’s not just a website, it’s an experience for consumers to learn about your brand & your services or products. My focus is on designing that unique web experience while using the best UI/UX practices for both desktop & mobile devices.

service 3
========
SOCIAL

Your brand is in the eyes of your consumers everyday through social media. It’s extremely important to use those platforms to continue to tell your story and sell your services in a visually pleasing way that catches their attention. My focus is to design content that communicates to your consumers better and builds brand awareness.

BEHIND THE DESIGNER

introduction ;;;;;;
My name is
nick martinez

My name is Nick I was born and raised San Diego, California. I attended San Diego State University where I found my passion for branding and website design. In 2013, I graduated from SDSU with a degree in Graphic Design and have been helping people bring their visions to life ever since. I truly love what I do for a living and that keeps me driven to sharpen my skills and become a better designer everyday. My goal is to always bring same drive and energy into every project I work on, no matter how big or how small.


When I’m not designing, I’m either surfing, camping, having a good time with friends & family, or just chillen with my lady and our dog. These are the things that make me happy.
